Objective is to share my knowledge of community building and developing, while also getting to continue my online career progress, and work on the next generation of projects.

Experience 
Minecraft server mod(2014-2016)
    -entry level role where I was tasked to interact with players and maintain a zero cheat policy with a log of 37000 players 
Minecraft server admin(2016-2018)
    -step up role where I was tasked with being available 24/7 in case of necessary server reboots or bug fixes. Developed polls and events as well as delighted moderator positions.
Minecraft server Dev(2018-2022) 
    -equitable position where I received profits share, while being tasked with formatting plugins and working closly with entire team to ensure a seemless transition. Still responsible for doing all responsibilities from both positions prior to this one.
